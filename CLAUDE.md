# Weather Slip — project notes

Read before exploring. Update when something architecturally significant
changes; don't let it drift.

## What this is

Shopify **public** embedded app: saves destination weather (current +
dispatch-day + delivery-day forecast) on each order as order metafields, so
packing slips, invoices and emails can print it with one Liquid line.
Free / Starter $4.99 / Pro $9.99 (`app/lib/plans.ts`). Scaffolded 2026-10-12
from `Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router` (React Router 7, Prisma,
Polaris web components). Sibling app for conventions/lessons:
`../store-performance-monitor` (its CLAUDE.md documents several Shopify CLI
and deploy traps this app's config already avoids).

## Core design — the rules that matter

- **We never render anyone's invoice.** Output is two order metafields in
  namespace `weather_slip` (`app/lib/constants.ts`): `summary` (one line of
  plain text — no emoji/HTML, it must survive PDF renderers) and `snapshot`
  (JSON, both °C and °F). Shopify's packing slip, Order Printer and Order
  Printer Pro all read `order.metafields.ns.key`. Snippets: `/app/snippets`.
- **Reprints never change by accident.** The first snapshot is written once
  per order; a retried `orders/create` is a no-op. Recompute only on: a real
  destination change (`locationKey` fingerprint differs) before shipping, a
  merchant Refresh, or a pending-date fill. Fulfillment **freezes** the
  snapshot (`frozenAt`) — it is not recomputed with the real ship date, so a
  slip printed while picking matches any later reprint.
- **Pending fill only fills.** A date beyond the provider's horizon prints
  "forecast pending"; `fillPendingDays` later fills just those days and
  leaves everything already printed untouched.
- **Every change is a new version** (`OrderWeatherSnapshot.version`); the
  highest is live. Old versions are kept.
- **Address data is minimised** (Level 2 protected customer data): the
  order query asks only for city/zip/country/coordinates; we store city,
  country, a 0.1° (~11 km) grid point and a hash. Never the street, name,
  email or phone. Jobs hold only the order ID, never the payload.
- **Weather cache is shared across shops**, keyed by provider + 0.1° grid
  cell, 3h TTL (`cache.server.ts`); geocodes 30 days.
- Usage: only an order's *first* snapshot counts; `consumeUsage` is an
  atomic conditional increment (verified: 5 concurrent at 48/50 → 2 granted).

## Weather providers

`WeatherProvider` interface (`app/lib/weather/types.ts`); labels come from
the provider. `WEATHER_PROVIDER` picks one:
- **`openweather` (default)** — free plan: 1M calls/month, 60/min, Current
  + 5 day/3 hour Forecast + Geocoding. **No 16-day daily on free** (paid
  Startup+), so `horizonDays = 4`; 3-hour slots are aggregated per
  destination-local day, dropping partial days (`aggregateDaily`).
  `OPENWEATHER_API_KEYS` is a comma list from one account: the next key is
  used **only on 401**. A 429 is not failed over — keys share an account
  quota, and spreading load over several accounts to dodge limits risks
  suspension. The user plans to move to a paid plan once installs grow;
  when that happens, switch the forecast call to the 16-day daily endpoint
  and raise `horizonDays`.
- `open-meteo` — kept as an alternative; its free endpoint is
  non-commercial, so it needs `OPEN_METEO_API_KEY` in production.
- Pro merchants may save their own key (AES-256-GCM, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`); it
  is tried first, ours behind it.
- OpenWeather gives a UTC offset, not an IANA zone: `utcOffsetSec` is kept
  exactly (India +5:30) — `destinationToday()` uses it. Don't round it.

## Hosting: Vercel now, AWS later (user decision, 2026-10-12)

- No long-running worker on Vercel. Queue = Postgres table `WeatherJob`,
  claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (`jobs.server.ts`), driven by the
  platform-neutral `drainQueue`/`runMaintenance` (`queue-runner.server.ts`):
  - webhooks enqueue, return 200, then `runInBackground(drainQueue())`
    (`background.server.ts` — Vercel `waitUntil`; the one file to change
    off Vercel);
  - `/api/cron/drain`, guarded by `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` —
    retries, pending fills, pruning. Called every 10 min by GitHub Actions
    (`.github/workflows/drain-queue.yml`, repo secrets `APP_URL` +
    `CRON_SECRET`) and daily by Vercel Cron as a backstop (`vercel.json`).
- **Vercel team "Test" (`test11-fc37`, account teampixeledge-1075) is on
  Hobby** (user decision 2026-10-12, budget). Hobby crons run at most daily,
  hence the GitHub Actions scheduler. Hobby's terms are non-commercial:
  upgrade to Pro before charging merchants, then set `vercel.json` back to
  `*/10` and delete the workflow. GitHub disables scheduled workflows after
  60 days without commits.
- Vercel CLI for this account uses its own config dir:
  `vercel --global-config ~/.vercel-teampixeledge …` (the default CLI login
  on this machine is a different account).
- `react-router.config.ts` applies `vercelPreset()` only when `VERCEL` is
  set, so the same repo still builds as a plain Node server (Dockerfile).
  AWS move: run the Docker image (App Runner/ECS) + `npm run worker`
  (`scripts/worker.ts`) or a scheduled Lambda calling `drainQueue`, and
  swap `runInBackground` — no queue/data changes needed.
- **Live**: https://weather-slip.vercel.app (Vercel project `weather-slip`,
  team `test11-fc37`, Git-connected to team-pixeledge/weather-slip `main`).
  Verified 2026-10-12: pages 200, cron 401 without secret / drains with it,
  webhooks 401 on a forged HMAC (what app review checks).
- Vercel gotchas hit on first deploy: a CLI-created project has no
  framework → static-only output, every route 404 — `vercel.json` pins
  `"framework": "react-router"`. A raw `buildCommand` runs without
  `node_modules/.bin` on PATH (exit 127) — build via `npm run vercel-build`.
- DB: Neon via the Vercel Marketplace (free plan, iad1, resource
  `weather-slip-db`). `DATABASE_URL` = pooled host,
  `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` = direct (migrate) — names the integration sets.
  `vercel.json` buildCommand runs `prisma migrate deploy` on every build.

## Not built yet / open

- **Phase 0 spike still open**: confirm on a dev store that the
  packing-slip and Order Printer Liquid read `weather_slip` metafields
  (and whether a `$app` namespace would also work — decide before launch,
  changing it later breaks every merchant's pasted snippet). Also check how
  often `shippingAddress.latitude/longitude` is populated.
- Billing API wiring (plans are enforced from `Shop.plan`, which nothing
  sets yet besides the default FREE), print action extension, order-details
  admin block, Pro backfill, heat/cold tags.
- Partner app "Weather-Slip" (org ThePixelEdge) is linked, but **`shopify
  app deploy` is blocked** until protected customer data access is
  declared in the Partner Dashboard (orders webhooks carry PCD). Request
  only what we use: Level 1 + the address field. Then rerun
  `shopify app deploy --config shopify.app.toml --allow-updates`.
  Still needed: a separate staging app/toml.
- `shop.ianaTimezone` is captured on install and refreshed per job.

## Verify

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test
npx react-router build            # Node build
VERCEL=1 npx react-router build   # Vercel build output
```
Local DB: `docker start weather-slip-db` (port 55450, see `.env.example`).
Never point a local run or `prisma migrate dev` at the Neon production URL.
